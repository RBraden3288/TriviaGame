# TriviaGame
A basic trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML.

I was able to create my HTML and CSS pages without a problem. 

After rewriting the Javascript and JQuery code multiple times, I have a game that displays a working start page,a time function, a question and answer display, and a results page.

However, the radio buttons that were extracted from Bootstrap only work once for ALL questions and I cannot get it to work for each, INDIVIDUAL question. With that in mind, I couldn't get my score to properly work without the former issue being worked out.

I tried working on this code since last week. I got the most progress done after I spent all Friday afternoon working with Rachel attempting to get it completed and all our variables and functions to work.

I definitely understand the method of .show() and .hide(). =P

But, through this assignment, I feel like I improved on more meaningful concepts that I was uncomfortable and poor at executing before like:

-time intervals,
-for loops,
-methods,
and
-logging and targeting key:pair values in arrays
