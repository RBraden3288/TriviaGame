# TriviaGame
A basic trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML.

I was able to create my HTML and CSS pages without a problem. 

My first attempt at writing this game focused on writing Javascript code for the questions and answers and having them display on the page correctly. Then when I tried to build my timer around the questions and answers, it simply didn't work.

My second attempt at writing this game focused on building the timer first and the questions and answers second. This worked much better because I found the function of my game was heavily reliant on a working timer. 

After rewriting the Javascript and JQuery code multiple times, I have a game that displays a working start page,a time function, a question and answer display, and a results page.

However, the radio buttons that were extracted from Bootstrap only work once for ALL questions and I cannot get it to work for each, INDIVIDUAL question. With that in mind, I couldn't get my score to properly work without the former issue being worked out.

I tried working on this code since last week. I got the most progress done after I spent all Friday afternoon working with Rachel attempting to get it completed and all our variables and functions to work.

I definitely understand the method of .show() and .hide(). =P

But, through this assignment, I feel like I improved on more meaningful concepts that I was uncomfortable and poor at executing before like:

-time intervals,
-for loops,
-methods,
and
-logging and targeting key:pair values in arrays
